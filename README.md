## Task 1: Real-time Ride-Share Tracking
Context:
Imagine you're a driver for a transportation agency in Kigali, ready to embark on your
daily route from Nyabugogo to Kimironko. It's your responsibility to pick up passengers at
five stops along the way. To help you and your passengers stay coordinated, you need a
platform that tells you how far you are from the next stop and how long it will take to get
there.
Objective:
Develop a web page, as illustrated in the screenshot, that utilizes the Google Maps API
to navigate a route. The page should display the estimated time to reach each upcoming
stop.
Route Details:
Weâ€™ve provided the geographical coordinates for the starting point, intermediate stops,
and ending point.

-  Starting Point: Nyabugogo (-1.939826787816454, 30.0445426438232)
-  Intermediate Stops:
- Stop A: (-1.9355377074007851, 30.060163829002217)
